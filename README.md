# Thesis

This project contains the source code that was used for the experiments in my bachelor thesis at Hochschule Mainz.
A proper readMe will be added after I have handed in my thesis and more time is available to create a detailed description.

For now I would like to refer any readers to my thesis for an explanation of
- the goal of this project and my thesis
- an explanation of the most important classes and their interaction

Every class is documented with JavaDoc so the interested reader can try to run the program and conduct experiments of their own.
